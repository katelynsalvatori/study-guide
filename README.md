# Study Guide
This is a simple command line CRUD application for creating "flashcard"-like study guides. A user can have multiple study guides, a study guide can have multiple questions, and a question can have multiple answers.

To set up the database run:
```
./setup.sh
```

Then, run the program with:
```
python study_guide.py
```

Follow the prompts on the command line.
